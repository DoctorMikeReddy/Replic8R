# Replic8R
​ So #LDJAM’s theme is “start with nothing” @ludumdare and #minijam’s is “Food”, 
with a limitation of “only arrow key input” @MiniJamOfficial

What if you were the AI software behind Star Trek’s replicator?

“Tea.Earl Grey. Hot…” 

Er… er… coming right up (?)… 

A nightmare in menu form. Many many menus… and with none of them in view

Resources used:
The menu demo cart from https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=27725
My versions of the Ludem Dare 45 and MiniJam 38 logos in Pico-8
Originals at https://ldjam.com/ and https://minijamofficial.com/ but I used the Twitter
icon for the latter.

Using Sublime Editor with Pico-8 and Lua extensions to just copy and paste :-)
