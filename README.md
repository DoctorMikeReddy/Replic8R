# Replic8R
​ So #LDJAM’s theme is “start with nothing” @ludumdare and #minijam’s is “Food”, 
with a limitation of “only arrow key input” @MiniJamOfficial 

Hmmm… I could TOTALLY do both, couldn’t I… with the same game…

What if you were the AI software behind Star Trek’s replicator?

“Tea.Earl Grey. Hot…” 

Er… er… coming right up (?)… 

A nightmare in menu form. Many many menus… and with none of them in view

Resources used:
The menu demo cart from https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=27725
My versions of the Ludem Dare 45 and MiniJam 38 logos in Pico-8
Originals at https://ldjam.com/ and https://minijamofficial.com/ but I used the Twitter
icon for the latter.
Stealing music from one cart to another http://www.robbyduguay.com/2015/11/sharing-music-between-pico-8-carts/
Using Sublime Editor with Pico-8 and Lua extensions to just copy and paste :-)

Wouldn't it be nice if I could get the theme in Pico-8 form; something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3TMFRkEyTE or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTEUGkTbXys
Ahah! What about THIS? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghtc3bUuANA
Yes!!!
(Or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7F63cJQe7k or 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=285AMK3kqrM 
which might be easier)

MIDI from here http://www.vic-fontaine.com/tng.php if I can get midi2pico working!
